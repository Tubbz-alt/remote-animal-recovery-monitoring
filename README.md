# Remote Animal Recovery Monitoring

## Brief

Like humans, dogs often suffer from injuries and joint problems but, unlike humans, there is no data resource to monitor postoperative recovery in small animals. Your task is to create a mobile phone app enabling dog carers to monitor progress of their dogs during recovery after orthopaedic surgery, provide information on what to expect, and connect them with their consultant. You will work with a leading veterinary orthopaedic surgeon specialising in treatment of these conditions, with the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for many animals with this new form of remote patient support.
